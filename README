This program implements a specific security policy for a house.

Policy:

Only users with an authorized key can enter the house. To enter the house, the user must first

- Insert their key in the lock
- Turn the key in the lock
- Enter the house

Note that testing if a key is valid is done only when the key is turned.

For turning the key and entering the house, it must be the same user that puts the key in the lock, turns the key, and enters the house.

A house can be rekeyed (this means that the old keys are no longer useable) with new keys only by the owner.

It is only physically possible to rekeyed the house when there is no key in the lock. For instance, there will never be a rekey between inserting a key and turning a key, or after turning a key successfuly and entering the house.

There is only one lock and one door. The lock will always be accessed in the following way

- insert key
- turn the key
- enter the house

Other commands can be issued in between insert, turn, and enter.

For example, the following situations will never happen:

- insert, enter
- insert, turn, insert
- turn, enter
- insert, turn, turn, enter
